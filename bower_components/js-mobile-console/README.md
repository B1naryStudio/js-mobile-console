## Overview

[Live demo](http://b1narystudio.github.io/js-mobile-console/).

It is extremely nice, that we are on the road of specifying and unifying remote
debugging protocol and we can already remotely debug web applications on desktop 
Chrome, but what if we want to get it working also on Android browser or 
Safari for iOs?

MobileConsole can be embedded within any page for debugging, it will catch errors
and behave exactly as native js console in browser. It also outputs all the logs
you've written via an API of window.console. 

### How is it different from all the existing instruments?

There are already plenty of ways for testing mobile applications. The most 
advanced is at the moment Chrome remote debugging. Still it is available only 
Chrome to Chrome.

Another way is to use [weinre](http://people.apache.org/~pmuellr/weinre-docs/latest/) - 
tool for remote debugging. It is quite nice and suggests rich functionality. Still 
it seems quite heavy for me. You should setup a dedicated server for it.

js-mobile-console is in contrast lightweight and requires almost no configuration,
you can just include it into your page and debug it when an error appears.

*stevemao* also stated that it may come handy for debugging 
[web views](https://github.com/B1naryStudio/js-mobile-console/issues/1).

### Loading
Css file should be included within html:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./style/mobile-console.min.css">
```
Console may be used without any modular system:
```html
<script src="./mobile-console.min.js"></script>
```

With help of browserify:
```js
var mobileConsole = require('js-mobile-console');
```

Or AMD style (RequireJS): 
```js
define(['js-mobile-console'], function(mobileConsole))
```

### Usage

Simple usage:
```js
mobileConsole.show();
```

Advanced usage: 
```js
mobileConsole.options({
	showOnError: true,
	proxyConsole: false,
	isCollapsed: true,
	catchErrors: true
});
```

Conditional toggling:
```js
if (condition) {
	mobileConsole.show();
} else {
	mobileConsole.hide();
}
```

Commands specifying:
```js
mobileConsole.commands({
	'check': 'var a = 10; a;',
	'run': '10/5'
});
```

### API

- **show** - show console with default options.
- **hide** - hide console.
- **options** - method to initialize console, by default will show console, 
accepts hash of options.
- **commands** - method to specify a hash of commands, which later can be 
executed within console.

### Options

- **showOnError** - *Default* false. Console will be hidden if no show method 
was called, but it will appear if any error occurs.
- **proxyConsole** - *Default* true. Determines if window.console methods are 
proxied to mobile console.
- **isCollapsed** - *Default* false. Determines if Console is collpased on startup.
- **catchErrors** - *Default* false. Determines if Console is registring 
window.onerror method in order to catch errors.
